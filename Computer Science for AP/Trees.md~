Tree
--------------
--------------
Non linear  

Each node can have > 1 next’s.  

root is a node with no previous nodes.  

parent of a node is the node that is prev.  

Tree has 0 or 1 root.  

Subtree:	
		-Tree formed by taking any node as a root  

Count of most number of edges you follow  

Depth of node is number of edges.  

leaf is node with no children  


Binary Tree  
       -2 children  
Ternary Tree  
	-3 children  


For binary trees
    node = n
leftchild = 2n+1
rightchild = 2n+2
parent = (n-1)/2
Don’t need references can mathematically find children



Use recursive methods to calculate things like height.  
##Tree Traversal
       

Breadth First Traversal  
	- Visit each level, one at a time.  
	- Never use it in a node based system, use when in an array.  

Depth First Traversal  
      	- Always visit you children first before visiting any neighboring node.  

Pre Order Traversal 
      	- Visit node before you visit any children.  

Post Order Traversal  
      	- Visit node after you visit all the children.  

Inorder Traversal  
	- Visit the node after you visit the left but before you visit the right.  


```java

void DFS(){
    DFS(head);
}


void DFS(BTNode<E> h){
    if(h == null){
        
    }
    else{
        DFS(h.left);
        DFS(h.right);
    }
}
```
